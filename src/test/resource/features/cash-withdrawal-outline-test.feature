# Database version:
  # KnowsTheDomain - constructor will setup Base.open() and delete all records.
  # TransactionProcessor -  will read the Messages file to see if any msgs.  Then process the message.
  #   It looks for the first record then either adds or subtracts from that account.  But we get the
  #   Instrumentation error.
